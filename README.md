Rock Paper Scissors

This took me a very long time to complete. I started over a few times and after a while I forgot to push my updates to Git. But I'm happy with it.

I decided to make the game go to 3 instead of 5, that way it's played first to 3 with the posibility of 5 rounds total, similar to real life rock, paper, scissors.

In the "Practice folder" you can see rps.html which was one of my restarts, that's where I finally figured out how to make the game run properly. I left it in as a reminder for myself.
